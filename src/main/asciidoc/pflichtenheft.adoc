== Purpose of this Document
The Software Requirement Specifications for the **{project_name}** are specified in this document.

The intended audiences of this document are project stakeholders, clients, and the development team. The communication between the parties is supposed to be based on the SRP and the content of this document. Furthermore, it is desired to use this document as the foundation of the contract between the contractor and client. Frequent validation and checks for consistency should be provided.

In general, the SRS should be correct, complete, and consistent. Upon delivery, the SRS is used to decide if the defined software has been delivered. After the stakeholders agree on the content of this document, changes should be kept to a minimum. Adjustments to this document should only be made to accommodate changes in requirements or changes in the environment.

[[task]]
== 1. Task Definition
In our small neighboring country ‘Gamblien’ the state-operated lottery ‘Mach Dein Glück’ is very popular. Also owned by the state are the widespread outlets selling lottery tickets. Gambiens minister for Economic Affairs, Lottermann, is planning the start of a ‘virtual lottery’ to win over foreigners as customers as well. Beforehand the current business of the lottery and its outlets is supposed to be converted on to computers and on this basis new services shall be tested. Currently ‘Mach Dein Glück’ has a number lottery, with weekly draws, and a footballtoto. The lottery ‘Mach Dein Glück’ is a conventional lottery “6 out of 49 with additional number”. Lottery tickets are submitted at the outlet till Saturday. On Sunday the drawing takes place under strict notarization. The footballtoto refers to the upper two classes of the german Bundesliga due to the shortage of a league of its own. Lottery tickets can be submitted until 24 hours before the beginning of a match day (possibly spread over multiple match days and only ending with the last rearranged match) in Bundesliga or cup round. The number lottery offers besides single tickets also permanent lottery tickets (monthly or (semi-)annually). Lottery tickets for the footballtoto can be filled out and submitted ahead of time arbitrarily after the publication of the match calendars.

According to Minister Lottermann’s plans in future the offers shall be designed more flexible due to the new media forms:

Winning pools will be supported. When opening a new winning pool the lottery will assign a community password. Users who know this password are allowed to enter a bet for the pool and are able to assign member passwords as well. With the member password the person can increase, decrease or temporarily suspend their share (integer multiples of the base stake) until betting stops (by cash or advanced payment). Changing a bet or the betted amount is possible up to 5 minutes before a draw or the beginning of a football match day.

Instead of paying in cash henceforth the money shall be booked from bank accounts at the Lotteriebank, which every customer will open there and to which they pay cash or transfer their betted amount on time. From this bank account the betted amounts will be booked (in the order of draws). If the money is not on the account the customer will receive a notice and does not take part in the bet. For each notice a fee of 2 € will be charged. After ten notices the customer will be removed from their winning pool temporarily.

Administrators of the lottery should be able to view an overview of the submitted bets of the customers and the financial situation (winnings/loses) of the lottery, to every drawing and match day.

Minister Lottermann has published an advertisement  under the reference number “MDG 2000” and asks for submissions of suitable, developable prototypes for such a system. Your SalesPoint-Team found out about this by chance and intends to enter the competition.

The lottery operator would be interested to get the data for the footballtoto directly and up-to-date from the internet. If the prototype could demonstrate that it would be seen as an advantage.

== 2. Product Usage
This passage is going to give you an overview on how the product is planned to be used when finished and under which circumstances.

The application is going to be used as an online lottery by the lottery ‘Mach Dein Glück’ to sell lottery tickets, let customers submit their bets and find out the result of the bet, winning pools are also included in the service. The software is supposed to run on a server and be available through the internet (via a browser) to interested customers 24/7.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome

The primary Users of the software are adults into betting, some might not be too familiar with website navigation schemas, as well as Administrators (staff of the lottery), who do not necessarily have a technical background. Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application.
